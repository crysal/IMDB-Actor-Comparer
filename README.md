# IMDB-Actor-Comparer
Wanna check out if actors from X seriese might also been in Y seriese, this cool webscraper will give you the list


Usage: ./script.sh \<ID OF THE FIRST IMDB SHOW> \<ID OF THE OTHER IMDB SHOW>

This will get the list of actors form each show then compare them and print any mathces.
Was thinking about just doing the top 10 or so from X show, but you can do that manually if you really need to
